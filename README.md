Deep Learning Fundamentals

1. Simple NN prediction: bike_sharing-neural_network
2. CNN: CIFAR-10 classifier - image_classifier-convolutional_network
3. RNN: Language Translation - language_translation_eng_fr-RNN
4. LSTM: TV Script Generation - tv_script_generation-rnn_lstm_network
5. GAN: Generate New Images Of Faces - face_generation-GAN


**Tensorflow 1.x** was used to train the models in this repo

[The projects were completed as part of Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
